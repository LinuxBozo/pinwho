# PinWho
Playing around with Phaser for game development. Simple pinball game.

## How to get this running or how to use it

### First Steps
Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) installed, and you can use the `npm` command:

```shell
$ npm version
```

Then install dependencies from the project root directory:

```shell
$ npm install
```

### Running locally

Start the local server:

```shell
$ npm start
```

This will create a server to listen on `localhost:9000` for requests, and will watch the source code for changes and reload the application as necessary.

Just point your browser at `http://localhost:9000` and click `Start` to play.
